// In this committee I will try to count how many seconds in the year. //
var secondsInAMinute = 60;
var minutesInAHour = 60;
var secondsInAnHour = secondsInAMinute * minutesInAnHour;

// And it turned out 3600 seconds per hour. // 
// Now there are seconds in the day. //
var hoursInADay = 24;
var secondsInADay = secondsInAnHour * hoursInADay;
secondsInADay;
// And we got 86400, which means that the day has 86400 seconds. //
// Now we count seconds in a year. //
var daysInAYear = 365;
var secondsInAYear = secondsInaDay * daysInAYear;
secondsInAYear;
// And we get 31536000, which means that in the year 31536000 seconds. //
// Now we will calculate the age in seconds, for example I am 20 years old. Now you need to write: //
var age = 20;
age * secondsInAYear;
// And we get 630720000. This means that if you are 20 years old, then you've already lived 630720000 seconds. //
